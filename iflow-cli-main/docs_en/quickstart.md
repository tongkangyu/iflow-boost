| **@** | File reference @filepath (e.g., `@src/App.tsx`) |
| **$** | Execute a specific subagent starting with `$` (e.g., `$code-reviewer`) |
| **Shell Commands** | Commands starting with `!` that execute system commands in CLI |
| **yolo** | Execution mode that allows CLI to perform all operations by default |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol, a server system for extending AI capabilities |
| **Sub Agent** | Intelligent Agent system for executing different specialized tasks |
| **Sub Command** | Command line extensions |
| **context left** | Indicator at the bottom right of CLI showing remaining context length during conversation |

#### Method 3: OpenAI Compatible API
> 💡 **Use Case**: Using your own model service or other OpenAI protocol-compatible services

⚠️ **Feature Limitations**:
- WebSearch service not supported
- WebFetch service not supported
- iFlow platform's built-in multimodal capabilities not supported
- Cannot enjoy iFlow platform models' tool calling optimization

**Configuration Steps:**
1. Select "OpenAI Compatible API" option
2. Enter service endpoint URL
3. Enter corresponding API Key

### Select Model
After successful login, choose your preferred large language model to start using

## Step 3: Run Your First Task (2 minutes)

### Method A: Project Analysis
```shell
# In any code project directory
cd your-project/
iflow
> /init
> Analyze the structure and main features of this project
```

### Method B: Simple Task
```shell
iflow
> Create a Python script that calculates the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence
```

### Method C: Shell Command Assistance
```shell
iflow
> !ls -la
> Help me analyze this directory structure and suggest how to organize the files
```
## Auto Update
iFlow CLI will check for the latest version when starting and will auto-update
### Auto Update Failed
If auto-update fails, manual update is required
```shell
# Update command
npm i -g @iflow-ai/iflow-cli to update
# Check latest version
iflow -v
```

### Uninstall and Reinstall
If manual update also fails, you need to uninstall and reinstall
```shell
# Uninstall
npm uninstall -g @iflow-ai/iflow-cli
# Check if iflow command still exists
iflow -v

# Reinstall
npm i -g @iflow-ai/iflow-cli
```

## Common Commands Quick Reference

| Command | Function | Example |
|---------|----------|----------|
| `/help` | View help | `/help` |
| `/init` | Analyze project structure | `/init` |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation history | `/clear` |
| `/exit` | Exit CLI | `/exit` |
| `!command` | Execute system command | `!npm install` |

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues
```shell
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Requires 22+

# Check network connection
curl -I https://apis.iflow.cn/v1
```

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure API key is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- Check if network connection is working
- Regenerate API key and try again

### Commands Not Responding
- Use `Ctrl+C` to interrupt current operation
- Run `/clear` to clear context
- Restart CLI: Use `/exit` then run `iflow` again
